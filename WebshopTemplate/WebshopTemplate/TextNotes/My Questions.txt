My questions in bullet form:

General:
- [x] Using the AddSingleton to a service when it is implemented?
- [x] How to use the `async` and `await` keywords in C# properly?

Database related:
- [x] Bidirectional relationships are nice / how to use it properly?
- [x] Index in DB can optimize and slow down at the same time / how to use it properly?
- [x] DBset and DBcontext are used to interact with the database, but how do you use them in the frontend?
- [x] How do you handle the frontend when you have a many to many relationship?
