My questions in bullet form:

- [x] Bidirectional relationships are nice / how to use it properly?
- [x] Index in DB can optimize and slow down at the same time / how to use it properly?
- [x] What is DBset and DBcontext and how are they different from each other?
- [x] DBset and DBcontext are used to interact with the database, but how do you use them in the frontend?
- [x] How do you handle the frontend when you have a many to many relationship?
