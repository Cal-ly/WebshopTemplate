My thoughts on implementing a Category for my Products class
Deciding between using a string, an enum, or implementing a new class for product categories in system design largely depends on the complexity of the overall needs and how one foresee managing categories in the future.
Each approach has its pros and cons, which I'll outline below, along with a recommendation for a scenario like a webshop where flexibility, scalability, and the ability to gather statistics are important.
With this in mind future development and maintenance of the system should be considered when making a decision, as well as the potential for changes in the categorization needs of the webshop.

--- String Approach
Pros:
  - Simplicity: Easy to implement and requires no additional classes or enums.
  - Flexibility: Can easily add new categories without changing the codebase.
Cons:
  - Prone to typos and inconsistency: Different users might enter variations of the same category (e.g., "Electronics" vs. "Electronic").
  - Harder to manage: No centralized place to see all categories or manage them.

--- Enum Approach
Pros:
  - Type safety: Reduces the risk of typos and ensures consistency across product categories.
  - Easy to use in switch statements or conditional logic within your code.
Cons:
  - Limited flexibility: Adding or changing categories requires code changes and redeployments, which can be cumbersome.
  - Scalability: As your webshop grows, the enum can become large and unwieldy, and changing enums might involve database migrations if you store the enum values in the database.

--- Class Approach (New `Category` Class)
Pros:
  - Flexibility and scalability: Allows for easy addition, removal, or modification of categories without code changes. You can manage categories directly in your database.
  - Richness: Enables storing additional information about categories (e.g., description, parent category for nested categories).
  - Enhanced statistics: Facilitates more complex queries and statistics, like sales per category, by leveraging Entity Framework's relationships and LINQ.
Cons:
  - Complexity: Requires more upfront design and implementation effort compared to the string or enum approaches.
  - Overhead: Adds another layer of objects to manage in your system.

Decision: Class Approach, given the requirements for flexibility, scalability, and the ability to generate detailed statistics, implementing a Category class would be the most advantageous approach.
It provides a robust foundation for future growth and changes to a webshop's categorization needs.
