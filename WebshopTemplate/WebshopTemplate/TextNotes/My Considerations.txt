My thoughts on implementing a Category for my Products class
Deciding between using a string, an enum, or implementing a new class for product categories in system design largely depends on the complexity of the overall needs and how one foresee managing categories in the future.
Each approach has its pros and cons, which I'll outline below, along with a recommendation for a scenario like a webshop where flexibility, scalability, and the ability to gather statistics are important.
With this in mind future development and maintenance of the system should be considered when making a decision, as well as the potential for changes in the categorization needs of the webshop.

String Approach
Pros:
  - Simplicity: Easy to implement and requires no additional classes or enums.
  - Flexibility: Can easily add new categories without changing the codebase.
Cons:
  - Prone to typos and inconsistency: Different users might enter variations of the same category (e.g., "Electronics" vs. "Electronic").
  - Harder to manage: No centralized place to see all categories or manage them.

Enum Approach
Pros:
  - Type safety: Reduces the risk of typos and ensures consistency across product categories.
  - Easy to use in switch statements or conditional logic within your code.
Cons:
  - Limited flexibility: Adding or changing categories requires code changes and redeployments, which can be cumbersome.
  - Scalability: As your webshop grows, the enum can become large and unwieldy, and changing enums might involve database migrations if you store the enum values in the database.

Class Approach (New `Category` Class)
Pros:
  - Flexibility and scalability: Allows for easy addition, removal, or modification of categories without code changes. You can manage categories directly in your database.
  - Richness: Enables storing additional information about categories (e.g., description, parent category for nested categories).
  - Enhanced statistics: Facilitates more complex queries and statistics, like sales per category, by leveraging Entity Framework's relationships and LINQ.
Cons:
  - Complexity: Requires more upfront design and implementation effort compared to the string or enum approaches.
  - Overhead: Adds another layer of objects to manage in your system.

Decision: Class Approach, given the requirements for flexibility, scalability, and the ability to generate detailed statistics, implementing a Category class would be the most advantageous approach.
It provides a robust foundation for future growth and changes to a webshop's categorization needs.

My thoughts on implementing a IdentityUser with a relationship for my Customer and Staff class'
Deciding to abstract login information away from Customer and Staff classes by not directly extending IdentityUser can enhance modularity and flexibility.

Pros:
 - Flexibility: Allows distinct management of user authentication separately from user role functionalities, enabling clearer separation of concerns.
 - Modularity: Easier to modify or extend user roles or authentication mechanisms without impacting the other.
 - Security: Limits exposure of sensitive authentication details by keeping them isolated.

Cons:
 - Complexity: Requires additional configuration to associate Customer and Staff with their respective IdentityUser records for authentication.
 - Development Overhead: Might increase the amount of boilerplate code for managing relationships and syncing data between user entities and authentication entities.
 - Potential for Inconsistencies: Without careful management, there's a risk of data mismatches between user data and authentication data.

Decision: Given the potential benefits of modularity and flexibility, abstracting login information away from Customer and Staff classes by not directly extending IdentityUser would be a good choice. It allows for more granular control over user authentication and role management, which can be beneficial in the long run.
